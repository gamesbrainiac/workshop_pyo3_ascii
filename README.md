# A Gentle Introudction to PyO3: Image to ASCII Art Converter

This is a simple program that compares the ASCII art generated by Rust as well as Python.

To make this work, you need to run the following commands:

```
cd pictoascii
maturin develop
```

And then, you can go ahead and run it using the following:

```
python main.py
```

Please note that you will get two new text files with the output from Python and Rust programs.
